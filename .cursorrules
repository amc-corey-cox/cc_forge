# Cursor Rules for CC Forge

**Important**: Read AGENTS.md for complete agent instructions. This file provides a summary.

## Project Overview

CC Forge is a CLI tool (`forge`) for safe, containerized AI agent sessions backed by local Ollama models. Changes go through a local Forgejo instance as a review gate.

## Key Files

- AGENTS.md - Complete agent instructions (READ THIS)
- DESIGN.md - Architecture and safety model
- ROADMAP.md - Implementation phases
- README.md - Quick start and usage

## Critical Rules

1. **No System Info**: Never embed hardware specs, IPs, usernames, or system paths in code
2. **Local-First**: Prefer solutions that work offline without external APIs
3. **Ask First**: For changes touching 3+ files, new dependencies, or architectural changes
4. **Transparency**: All agent actions should be logged and traceable

## Code Style

- Python is the primary language
- CLI framework: Click
- HTTP client: httpx
- Container management: Docker SDK
- Use type hints for public interfaces
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Docstrings for public functions only

## Git Workflow

- Branch from main
- Descriptive branch names: feature/*, fix/*
- PRs require clear descriptions
- Never commit secrets
