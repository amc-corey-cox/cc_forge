# Cursor Rules for CC Forge

**Important**: Read AGENTS.md for complete agent instructions. This file provides a summary.

## Project Overview

CC Forge is a local-first AI agents development system. You are helping build a self-improving autonomous software development pipeline.

## Key Files

- AGENTS.md - Complete agent instructions (READ THIS)
- DESIGN.md - Architectural vision
- ROADMAP.md - Implementation plan
- README.md - Public project description

## Critical Rules

1. **No System Info**: Never embed hardware specs, IPs, usernames, or system paths in code
2. **Local-First**: Prefer solutions that work offline without external APIs
3. **Ask First**: For changes touching 3+ files, new dependencies, or architectural changes
4. **Transparency**: All agent actions should be logged and traceable

## Code Style

- Python is the primary language
- Use type hints for public interfaces
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Docstrings for public functions only

## Git Workflow

- Branch from main
- Descriptive branch names: feature/*, fix/*
- PRs require clear descriptions
- Never commit secrets

## Teams

This project has four agent teams:
- Dev Team: Creates PRs from issues
- Test Team: Writes and verifies tests
- Red Team: Adversarial review
- Blue Team: Test quality validation

Understand which team's code you're working on and respect boundaries.
